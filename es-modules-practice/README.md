## Differences between ES Module Syntax and CommonJS

1. **Import/Export Syntax**: With ES Modules, you use `import` and `export` to share code between files. In CommonJS, you use `require()` to bring in code and `module.exports` to share it.
2. **File Extension**: ES Modules usually use `.mjs` files, or `.js` files if you set `"type": "module"` in your `package.json`. CommonJS just uses `.js` files.
3. **How They Load**: ES Modules can load files asynchronously (which can be faster in some cases), while CommonJS loads files one after another (synchronously).

## Why Use ES Modules in Node.js Projects?

1. **It's the Standard**: ES Modules are now the official way to organize JavaScript code, so the code will work the same in Node.js and in browsers.
2. **Smaller Code**: ES Modules let you only include the parts of code you actually use, which can make the project smaller.
3. **Better Tools**: Because ES Modules have a clear structure, code editors and tools can help you more easily find mistakes and write better code.
4. **Works Well with Modern Libraries**: ES Modules are supported by most new JavaScript libraries and frameworks, so it's easier
